# ðŸ¦· Teeth Image Classification using Custom CNN

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify teeth conditions into 7 distinct classes using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) & fine-tuned VGG16 model.  
It includes **training**, **validation**, **testing**.

**This project performs teeth image classification using two approaches:**
-A Custom CNN model built from scratch
-A fine-tuned VGG16 model (transfer learning)
It also includes a Streamlit app to deploy the model for real-time predictions from uploaded images.

**I will update it**
